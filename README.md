### CSS Framework
Bootstrap was the chosen framework for styling my project. I used the Bootstrap grid extensively to support responsiveness on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. 

### Colour Palette
Colours used in this project were sourced from [Colour Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/). Essentially, the colours are seeking to capture key attributes of The Monkees through energy, intelligence, country rock and psychedelia

Colour         | Hex Code
---------------|----------
Yellow         | #F78A00
Orange         | #F05F40
Charcoal Grey  | #343A40
Pencil Grey    | #BFBFBF
White          | #FFFFFF

### Typography
[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/) font wwas used throughout this project.

### Icon Graphics
Font Awesome 5 icon graphics were used in conjunction with Bootstrap 4, primarily to support the features section, as viewed in `index.html` page 

Page                   | Function                            | Font  
-----------------------|------------------------------------ |-------
index.html             | features                            | `fas fa-glass-whiskey`

### Navbar Design
For tablet and desktop views, the navbar offers 6 functions on show. For mobile devices, all the same options collapse into a 'hamburger' design.

## Features

### index.html

Navbar (repeated on all pages) has been designed to include a clickable icon image that is synonymous with the bands brand. The user will always return to the home page with. In addition, the navbar allows the user to navigate to ‘music’, ‘heyhey’ and ‘events & tickets’ pages. A ‘hamburger’ design has been built to collapse the navbar for Mobile devices.

A full black and white image of the band is on show from the header through to the first container ‘headline news’. I was inspired by the design as a result of completing the bootstrap training. The thought of scrolling the image creates a sense of something next.   

‘Headline News’ is central to the home page. Users are notified up front of important information concerning the band. Summary news of 2021 world tour is supported by use of icons, sourced from bootstrap / font awesome5.

Further news of a 2021 world tour appears on home page via a ‘bootstrap’ card design. The design has been further modified to include a clickable button to allow user to check availability of tickets via a navigation link through to ‘events & tickets’ page. All buttons are subject to .hover pseudo class that provides a status colour change to the user when their cursor is placed upon the selected button. Furthermore, the user can view the concert venue by clicking on the card image.

Footer (repeated on all pages) includes trading links to tickets and bookings. Social media links and fonts secured from bootstrap / font awesome5. The links are wired to the bands’ respective social media sites. Again, the .hover pseudo class has been used to provide a background colour change (yellow to custom corporate colour) and font colour change too. Site links allow the use to access music, heyhey and events & tickets pages. The lower footing allows for The Monkees performing years, powered by Javascript, copyright and web designer information.
